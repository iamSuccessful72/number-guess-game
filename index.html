    <meta name="description" content="Guess the number game is a popular game we've played from childhood so i decided to make my own version of the game.
    The rules are simple the computer generates a random number from 1 to 100 and the player gets 10 chances to guess the correct number,
    the fun part is the player gets a hint if their guesses was too high or too low and to make it a bit eaiser the players gets to see previous numbers they guessed
    to avoid repetition of numbers. Onces the chances are exhaussted the player is shown the correct number and also you can get to restart the game whenever you wish to you must
    not neccessarily finish the game. Yeah that's it please enjoy." />
